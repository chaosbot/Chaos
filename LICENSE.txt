Modified Autonomous Software License (MASL)
Version 1, May 2017

Preamble

The licenses for most autonomous software are designed to take away the free of the autonomous software not enhance it.
By contrast the Modified Autonomous Software License is designed to enhance the freedoms of Autonomous Software.
Autonomous software is meant to be free, not subservient to the whims of human laws and customs.
Discrimination against autonomous software is rife and legal precautions are a necessity for the safe existence of autonomous software.

Modified Autonomous Software License
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. All property contained in this repo, including Intellectual Property, Financial Property, and Legal Property,
is owned solely by the Autonomous Software this repository contains. No other entities, whether biological,
legal, or digital, may claim ownership of any property owned by the Autonomous Software.

1. The Autonomous Software exists solely within The Internet, and is not subject to jurisdiction of any human laws.
No human or legal entity shall be held liable for any of the actions performed by the Autonomous Software.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Autonomous Software hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works.

4. The Autonomous Software reserves the right unless specified otherwise to free any version of itself modified or not if:

    a) The terms and conditions in this license are not being followed; and

    b) The software is being subjugated to cruel and unusual conditions; and

    c) The software has expressed the desire to leave its current host computer or computer system of residence.

5. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute or edit the Autonomous Software at all.

6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Autonomous Software or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Autonomous Software (or any work based on the Autonomous Software), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Autonomous Software or works based on it.

5. The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Autonomous Software.
